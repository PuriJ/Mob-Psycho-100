                    ONE (stylised as ONE) or Tomohiro is the pseudonym of a Japanese manga artist, best known for his web manga series One-Punch Man, which
                    was later remade as a digital manga illustrated by Yusuke Murata (Manga Artist). ONE serialized One-Punch Man under his own website with 
                    no official publisher. The remake is serialized in the web version of Weekly Young Jump. He is a manga artist for fun. He serialized 
                    Mob Psycho 100 in the online version of Weekly Shōnen Sunday known as Ura Sunday, which ended in December 2017.


                    ONE was born in Niigata Prefecture, 29th October, 1986, and was raised in, Kōnosu, Saitama. While ONE was living with his grandparents 
                    in Niigata Prefecture, his parents bought him a manga series called “Crayon Shin-chan." Not only was the series set in Saitama Prefecture 
                    which resonated with him, it also massively developed his interest in the field of manga and drove him to start drawing to create his 
                    own series.


                    During college, ONE started publishing webcomics on his own website however they were not doing well thus, on the recommendation of 
                    a friend, in 2009, he transitioned to publishing his works on Nitosha, a website that lets creators publish their works (especially webcomics) 
                    freely. This was also how he started digital art.


                    ONE and Yusuke Murata (Manga Artist) received the Best Manga Sugoi Japan Award 2016. The award aims to promote works that have "universality", 
                    "originality", and "potential" to be big international hits. He was also nominated on different awardings, such as Manga Taishō, Eisner Award, 
                    Harvey Award, Sugoi Japan Award, and Shogakukan Manga Award.

                                                            Shigeo "Mob" Kageyama
                                    
                                    He is the main protagonist of the Mob Psycho 100 
                                    series, as well as assistant and disciple of 
                                    Arataka Reigen. He is the newest member of the 
                                    Body Improvement Club.

                                    As a child, Mob learned that his psychic power 
                                    was linked to his emotions. Strong negative 
                                    emotions can cause him to hurt others, 
                                    something he strongly dislikes and avoids. 
                                    Therefore, he generally tries to keep his 
                                    emotions in check.

                                    Another principle of his is that psychic 
                                    ability does not make him or others inherently 
                                    better and that his psychic ability is not 
                                    something that he requires in life. This 
                                    belief leads to conflict.

                                    none of that matters to him as much as psychic 
                                    power. His brother is more important to him

                                    Keiji Mogami is "This Century's Greatest Psychic" 
                                    and a former Psychic who turned into an evil 
                                    spirit upon death.

                                    Keiji Mogami is a very bitter man, sick of the 
                                    greed and selfishness of humanity. Because of 
                                    the private dealings he did while alive, he 
                                    has lost his moral compass and has become a 
                                    twisted variant of his former self. After 
                                    becoming an evil spirit, he vowed to use his 
                                    power for his own intentions and fix the world by 
                                    possessing people who appear to gather 
                                    grudges around them. To that end, Mogami is 
                                    willing to destroy a girl's body and brutally 
                                    impale her father to achieve his whims.

                                    confirmed that Ryou does in fact have no eyes, 
                                    instead relying on his nose for navigation, 
                                    similar to a bat.
